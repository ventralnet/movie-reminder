Twenty-six ways to die. The ABC's OF DEATH is perhaps the most ambitious anthology film ever conceived with productions spanning fifteen countries and featuring segments directed by over two dozen of the world's leading talents in contemporary genre film. Inspired by children's educational books, the motion picture is comprised of twenty-six individual chapters; each helmed by a different director assigned a letter of the alphabet. The directors were then given free reign in choosing a word to create a story involving death. Provocative, shocking, funny and ultimately confrontational, THE ABC's OF DEATH is the definitive vision of modern horror diversity.

Japan is picking itself up from the devastation of World War II and preparing to host the 1964 Olympics - and the mood is one of both optimism and conflict as the young generation struggles to throw off the shackles of a troubled past. While the children work together to save a dilapidated Meiji era club house from demolition, their tentative relationship begins to blossom. But - in an unexpected twist that parallels what the country itself is facing - a buried secret from their past emerges to cast a shadow on the future and pull them apart.

With Ina May as their leader, the women taught themselves midwifery from the ground up, and, with their families, founded an entirely communal, agricultural society called The Farm. They grew their own food, built their own houses, published their own books, and, as word of their social experiment spread, created a model of care for women and babies that changed a generation's approach to childbirth. Forty years ago Ina May led the charge away from isolated hospital birthing rooms, where husbands were not allowed and mandatory forceps deliveries were the norm. Today, as nearly one third of all US babies are born via C-section, she fights to preserve her community's hard-won knowledge. With incredible access to the midwives' archival video collection, the film not only captures the unique sisterhood at The Farm Clinic-from its heyday into the present-but shows childbirth the way most people have never seen it-unadorned, unabashed, and awe-inspiring.

When Aurora is hospitalized, she sends her neighbor, Pilar, to pass word of her grave condition to Gian Luca, a man of which no one has ever heard her speak. Pilar's quest to fulfill her friend's wish transports us to Africa fifty years earlier, before the start of the Portuguese Colonial War. We see Aurora again, this time as the gorgeous, smoldering wife of a wealthy young farmer, involved in a forbidden love affair with Gian Luca, her husband's best friend. Their moving, poetic tale is conveyed through the older Gian Luca's suave voiceover, combined with the lush, melodious sounds of its heady, tropical setting, peppered with a soundtrack of Phil Spector songs. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/67/11166763_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/67/11166763_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/67/11166763_det.jpg","original":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/67/11166763_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Teresa Madruga","id":"335719615","characters":["Pilar"]},{"name":"Laura Soveral","id":"364661207","characters":["Old Aurora"]},{"name":"Ana Moreira","id":"770687040","characters":["Young Aurora"]},{"name":"Henrique Espirito Santo","id":"770823193","characters":["Old Ventura"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2153963"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771305392.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tabu_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771305392/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771305392/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771305392/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771305392/similar.json"}},{"id":"771315194","title":"Leviathan","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"Unrated","runtime":87,"release_dates":{"theater":"2013-03-01"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Fresh","critics_score":72,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":67},"synopsis":"in the very waters where melville's pequod gave chase to moby dick, leviathan captures the collaborative clash of man, nature, and machine. shot on a dozen cameras - tossed and tethered, passed from fisherman to filmmaker - it is a cosmic portrait of one of mankind's oldest endeavors.
