After a competitive casting process, the roles are eventually allocated, and the prisoners begin exploring the text, finding in its tale of fraternity, power and betrayal parallels to their own lives and stories. Hardened criminals, many with links to organised crime, these actors find great motivation in performing the play. As we witness the rehearsals, beautifully photographed in various nooks and crannies within the prison, we see the inmates also work through their own conflicts, both internal and between each other. -- (C) Adopt","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/53/11165325_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/53/11165325_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/53/11165325_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/53/11165325_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Cosimo Rega","id":"771436179","characters":["Himself/Cassius"]},{"name":"Salvatore Striano","id":"771398709","characters":["Bruto","Himself/Brutus"]},{"name":"Giovanni Arcuri","id":"771398707","characters":["Cesare","Himself/Caesar"]},{"name":"Antonio Frasca","id":"771398705","characters":["Himself/Mark Anthony","Marcantonio"]},{"name":"Juan Dario Bonetti","id":"771398708","characters":["Decio","Himself/Decius"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2177511"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771284344.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/caesar_must_die_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771284344/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771284344/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771284344/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771284344/similar.json"}},{"id":"771247162","title":"Texas Chainsaw 3D","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"R","runtime":92,"critics_consensus":"As an ugly and cynical attempt to rebrand Leatherface as horror anti-hero, Texas Chainsaw 3D is a bold move for the franchise.","release_dates":{"theater":"2013-01-04","dvd":"2013-05-14"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":19,"audience_rating":"Spilled","audience_score":49},"synopsis":"A chainsaw-yielding killer known as Leatherface terrorizes a group of young teens.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/74/11167480_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/74/11167480_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/74/11167480_det.jpg","original":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/74/11167480_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Alexandra Daddario","id":"770777867","characters":["Heather Miller"]},{"name":"Dan Yeager","id":"771376161","characters":["Leatherface"]},{"name":"Tremaine 'Trey Songz' Neverson","id":"771418722","characters":["Ryan"]},{"name":"Scott Eastwood","id":"770839379","characters":["Carl","Deputy Carl Hartman"]},{"name":"Tania Raymonde","id":"760383089","characters":["Nikki"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1928299"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771247162.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/texas_chainsaw_3d/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771247162/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771247162/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771247162/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771247162/similar.json"}},{"id":"770748938","title":"Mirchi","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"Unrated","runtime":155,"release_dates":{"theater":"2013-02-07"},"ratings":{"critics_score":-1,"audience_rating":"Spilled","audience_score":54},"synopsis":"","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/84/84/10848400_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/84/84/10848400_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/84/84/10848400_det.jpg","original":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/10/84/84/10848400_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Prabhas","id":"770670162"},{"name":"Anushka Shetty","id":"770697897"},{"name":"Richa Gangopadhyay","id":"770871228"},{"name":"Sathyaraj","id":"770670859"},{"name":"Nadhiya","id":"770767748"}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2469980"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770748938.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mirchi/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770748938/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770748938/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770748938/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770748938/similar.json"}},{"id":"771270468","title":"The Jeffrey Dahmer Files","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"Unrated","runtime":76,"release_dates":{"theater":"2013-02-15"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Fresh","critics_score":65,"audience_rating":"Spilled","audience_score":40},"synopsis":"In 1991 Jeffrey Dahmer was arrested in Milwaukee and sentenced to 957 years in prison for killing 17 people and dismembering their bodies.
