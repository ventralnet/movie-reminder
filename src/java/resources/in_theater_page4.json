There's no telephone, running water or medical aid, The locals, whose daily routines have barely changed over the last centuries, live according to their own values and cultural traditions. With insightful commentary written and narrated by Herzog, HAPPY PEOPLE: A YEAR IN THE TAIGA follows one of the Siberian trappers through all four seasons of the year to tell the story of a culture virtually untouched by modernity.

Their budding but illicit romance screeches to a tragic halt when interplanetary-border patrol agents catch them and Eden suffers an apparently fatal fall. But when, ten years later, Adam learns she is alive and working at a vast corporation whose towering headquarters connects their planets, he sets out on a dangerous quest to infiltrate the company and the upper world to reconnect with her.

Eli's mother is a drug addict, and his father is physically abusive. When police answer a domestic disturbance call at Eli's home on his 10th birthday, the young boy is placed in a youth facility where compliance takes precedence over compassion. Meanwhile, Ken Matthews is an investment banker with a bright future. In a calculated effort to dazzle his latest client, a wealthy heiress, Ken volunteers at a youth camp for at-risk children. There, he's paired with Eli. As the two settle into the cabin shared with compassionate counselor Samuel and his quirky charge Redford, it doesn't take long for Ken to realize that he's way out of his league. Eli sees right through Ken, and lashes out at him whenever possible. At first, Ken responds with frustration and anger. The more he learns about Eli's tragic past however, the more his heart goes out to him. In time Ken learns to love Eli unconditionally, a love that's soon challenged when the young boy's brutish father pays an unexpected visit to the camp. At that moment Eli's plight becomes real to Ken, prompting the once-neglectful counselor to do some serious soul searching, and make a sacrifice that could drastically alter the future of the boy who's stuck in a dangerous downward spiral. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/01/11170153_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/01/11170153_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/01/11170153_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/01/11170153_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Michael Mattera","id":"771436535","characters":["Ken","Ken Matthews"]},{"name":"Miles Elliot","id":"771436533","characters":["Eli"]},{"name":"Asante Jones","id":"771278978","characters":["Samuel","Samuel Smith"]},{"name":"Michael Jacob Wayne","id":"771439363","characters":["Redford"]},{"name":"Grace Johnston","id":"770680671","characters":["Tammi","Tammie Parker"]}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771350030.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/camp_2013/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771350030/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771350030/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771350030/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771350030/similar.json"}},{"id":"771269006","title":"Stand Up Guys","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"R","runtime":94,"critics_consensus":"Stand Up Guys largely wastes its talented cast in a resolutely mediocre comedy hampered by messy direction and a perfunctory script.","release_dates":{"theater":"2013-02-01","dvd":"2013-05-21"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":36,"audience_rating":"Spilled","audience_score":50},"synopsis":"Val (Al Pacino) is released from prison after serving twenty-eight years for refusing to give up one of his close criminal associates.

Directors Kristi Jacobson and Lori Silverbush examine this issue through the lens of three people for who are struggling with food insecurity: Barbie, a single Philadelphia mother who grew up in poverty and is trying to provide a better life for her two kids; Rosie, a Colorado second-grader who often has to depend on friends and neighbors to feed her and has trouble concentrating in school; and Tremonica, a Mississippi second-grader whose asthma and health issues are exacerbated by the largely empty calories her hardworking mother can afford. Their stories are interwoven with insights from experts including sociologist Janet Poppendieck, author Raj Patel and nutrition policy leader Marion Nestle; ordinary citizens like Pastor Bob Wilson and teachers Leslie Nichols and Odessa Cherry; and activists such as Witness to Hunger's Mariana Chilton, Top Chef's Tom Colicchio and Oscar (R)-winning actor Jeff Bridges. Ultimately, Finding North shows us how hunger poses serious economic, social and cultural implications for our nation, and that it could be solved once and for all, if the American public decides - as they have in the past - that making healthy food available and affordable is in the best interest of us all.
