His world is shaken when a middle-aged woman from his past (Orly Silbersatz, Broken Wings) walks into his examination room. Their brief and distressing reunion along with troubles at work, spur Yossi to take an overdue vacation. On a road trip to Eilat, a chance encounter with a group of young Israeli IDF officers, among them Tom (rising star Oz Zehavi, Southland) a handsome and openly gay man, allows Yossi to move on from his grief and begin to live again. One of Israel's most noted directors and best chroniclers of gay life, Eytan Fox was born in New York and moved to Israel at an early age. He graduated from Tel Aviv University's School of Film and Television. His previous film, the Berlin International Film Festival and LA Outfest Award Winner The Bubble, follows three roommates in Tel Aviv, a political activist and two gay men, one of whom (played by YOSSI's Ohad Kneller) falls in love with a Palestinian. Mr. Fox's Walk on Water starred YOSSI's Lior Ashkenazi as a Mossad officer under cover confronting the Nazi past of an upper class young German man.

With Ina May as their leader, the women taught themselves midwifery from the ground up, and, with their families, founded an entirely communal, agricultural society called The Farm. They grew their own food, built their own houses, published their own books, and, as word of their social experiment spread, created a model of care for women and babies that changed a generation's approach to childbirth. Forty years ago Ina May led the charge away from isolated hospital birthing rooms, where husbands were not allowed and mandatory forceps deliveries were the norm. Today, as nearly one third of all US babies are born via C-section, she fights to preserve her community's hard-won knowledge. With incredible access to the midwives' archival video collection, the film not only captures the unique sisterhood at The Farm Clinic-from its heyday into the present-but shows childbirth the way most people have never seen it-unadorned, unabashed, and awe-inspiring.

Matt Damon plays Steve Butler, an ace corporate salesman who is sent along with his partner, Sue Thomason (Frances McDormand), to close a key rural town in his company's expansion plans. With the town having been hit hard by the economic decline of recent years, the two outsiders see the local citizens as likely to accept their company's offer, for drilling rights to their properties, as much-needed relief. What seems like an easy job for the duo becomes complicated by the objection of a respected schoolteacher (Hal Holbrook) with support from a grassroots campaign led by another man (John Krasinski), as well as the interest of a local woman (Rosemarie DeWitt).
