When Ali lands a job as a bouncer in a nearby nightclub, things quickly start to look up for the itinerant father and son. Then one night, after breaking up a fight in the club, Ali meets the radiant Stephanie (Marion Cotillard), and slips her his number after dropping her off safely at home. Though Stephanie's position on the high end of the social spectrum makes romance an unlikely prospect for the pair, a tragic accident at Marineland robs her of her legs, and finds her reaching out in desperation to Ali. Her spirit broken by the same tragedy that took her legs, Stephanie gradually finds the courage to go on living trough transcendent moments spent with Ali -- a man with precious little pity, but an enormous love of life. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/69/11166900_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/69/11166900_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/69/11166900_det.jpg","original":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/69/11166900_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Marion Cotillard","id":"162688286","characters":["Stephanie"]},{"name":"Matthias Schoenaerts","id":"403904587","characters":["Ali"]},{"name":"Armand Verdure","id":"771409782","characters":["Sam"]},{"name":"Celine Sallette","id":"623771785","characters":["Louise"]},{"name":"Corinne Masiero","id":"771101746","characters":["Anna"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2053425"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771303199.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rust_and_bone/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771303199/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771303199/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771303199/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771303199/similar.json"}}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/dvds/current_releases.json?page_limit=16&country=us&page=3","next":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/dvds/current_releases.json?page_limit=16&country=us&page=4","prev":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/dvds/current_releases.json?page_limit=16&country=us&page=2","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/dvd/current_releases.php"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/dvds/current_releases.json?page_limit={results-per-page}&page={page-number}&country={country-code}"}
