She escapes from the camp with an older albino soldier and experiences for the very first time the joys of a peaceful and loving life, but a fresh tragedy will force her to confront and fight the ghosts haunting her mind. Although inspired by a real story that took place in Burma, Nguyen decided to film War Witch in the Democratic Republic of the Congo without giving a specific location to the plot. He worked on the film for 10 years, watching and catching children's points of view with his camera and mixing in tightly edited flashbacks in which the spirits of human beings appear with an ultra-realistic and violent storyline. But War Witch is also a poignant and impossible love story filled with magic, picturesque images, and even light moments like the powerful visit to an albino camp or the chasing of a white rooster.

An ordinary British stockbroker, Nicholas Winton organized the rescue of 669 Czech and Slovak children just before the outbreak of World War II. Winton, now 103 years old, did not speak about these events with anyone for more than half a century. His heroism would have probably been forgotten if his wife, fifty years later, hadn't found a suitcase in the attic, full of documents and transport plans. Today the story of this rescue is known around the world, and thousands of descendants of 'Nicky's Family' continue to follow in his footsteps to do good. \"Nicky's Family\" has earned rave reviews from audiences and critics around the world, winning over 29 awards - including 13 audience awards from U.S. film festivals!","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif","profile":"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif","detailed":"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif","original":"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Klara Issova","id":"770688886"},{"name":"Michal Slany","id":"771069348"}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771259361.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nickys_family_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771259361/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771259361/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771259361/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771259361/similar.json"}},{"id":"771315027","title":"Ginger & Rosa","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"PG-13","runtime":89,"critics_consensus":"Elle Fanning gives a terrific performance in Ginger & Rosa, but she's let down by the film's vague, dramatically limp script.","release_dates":{"theater":"2013-03-15"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Fresh","critics_score":72,"audience_rating":"Spilled","audience_score":41},"synopsis":"London, 1962. Two teenage girls - GINGER & ROSA - are inseparable. They skip school together, talk about love, religion and politics and dream of lives bigger than their mothers' domesticity. But the growing threat of nuclear war casts a shadow over their lives. Ginger (Elle Fanning) is drawn to poetry and protest, while Rosa (Alice Englert) shows Ginger how to smoke cigarettes, kiss boys and pray. Both rebel against their mothers: Rosa's single mum, Anoushka (Jodhi May), and Ginger's frustrated painter mother, Natalie (Christina Hendricks). Meanwhile, Ginger's pacifist father, Roland (Alessandro Nivola) seems a romantic, bohemian figure to the girls. He encourages Ginger's 'Ban-the-Bomb' activism, while Rosa starts to take a very different interest in him. As Ginger's parents fight and fall apart, Ginger finds emotional sanctuary with a gay couple, both named Mark (Timothy Spall and Oliver Platt), and their American friend, the poet Bella (Annette Bening). Finally, as the Cuban Missile Crisis escalates - and it seems the world itself may come to an end - the lifelong friendship of the two girls is shattered. Ginger clutches at one hope; if she can help save the world from extinction, perhaps she too will survive this moment of personal devastation.
