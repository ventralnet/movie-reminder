They're both quite brief, and in a similar style, so it works.

The story centers on an innocent romance beginning to bud between Umi and Shun, two high school kids caught up in the changing times. Japan is picking itself up from the devastation of World War II and preparing to host the 1964 Olympics - and the mood is one of both optimism and conflict as the young generation struggles to throw off the shackles of a troubled past. While the children work together to save a dilapidated Meiji era club house from demolition, their tentative relationship begins to blossom. But - in an unexpected twist that parallels what the country itself is facing - a buried secret from their past emerges to cast a shadow on the future and pull them apart.

Young Ricky is a community leader and father, whose gang is aligned to one party. One day he meets Kamala, who belongs to a community controlled by the other party, and the two instantly connect. Will their love triumph, or will bigger forces win the day? Based on true events. Better Mus' Come is the debut film of writer/director Storm Saulter and was produced by award-winning filmmaker Paul Bucknor (The Full Monty). The film has a sizzling original score and all Jamaican lead cast, with an electrifying cameo appearance by Roger Guenveur Smith (Malcolm X, Do the Right Thing, American Gangster) as Prime Minister, delivering the political speech that ended with the promise, \"Better Mus Come!\", reflecting his party's commitment to greater social justice and equality for all Jamaicans.

The film was made in Rome's Rebibbia Prison, where the inmates are preparing to stage Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. After a competitive casting process, the roles are eventually allocated, and the prisoners begin exploring the text, finding in its tale of fraternity, power and betrayal parallels to their own lives and stories. Hardened criminals, many with links to organised crime, these actors find great motivation in performing the play. As we witness the rehearsals, beautifully photographed in various nooks and crannies within the prison, we see the inmates also work through their own conflicts, both internal and between each other. -- (C) Adopt","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/53/11165325_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/53/11165325_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/53/11165325_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/53/11165325_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Cosimo Rega","id":"771436179","characters":["Himself/Cassius"]},{"name":"Salvatore Striano","id":"771398709","characters":["Bruto","Himself/Brutus"]},{"name":"Giovanni Arcuri","id":"771398707","characters":["Cesare","Himself/Caesar"]},{"name":"Antonio Frasca","id":"771398705","characters":["Himself/Mark Anthony","Marcantonio"]},{"name":"Juan Dario Bonetti","id":"771398708","characters":["Decio","Himself/Decius"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2177511"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771284344.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/caesar_must_die_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771284344/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771284344/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771284344/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771284344/similar.json"}},{"id":"770798607","title":"Carmen: Royal Opera House/London","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"Unrated","runtime":150,"release_dates":{"theater":"2013-01-06"},"ratings":{"critics_score":-1,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":100},"synopsis":"With Anna Caterina Antonacci and Jonas Kaufmann bringing rare erotic intensity to the drama of Carmen and Don Jose, this new Royal Opera production is a darkly passionate reading of one of the world's favourite operas.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif","profile":"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif","detailed":"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif","original":"http://images.rottentomatoescdn.com/images/redesign/poster_default.gif"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Anna Caterina Antonacci","id":"770694899"},{"name":"Jonas Kaufmann","id":"770779008"}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770798607.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/carmen-royal-opera-houselondon/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770798607/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770798607/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770798607/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770798607/similar.json"}}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/in_theaters.json?page_limit=16&country=us&page=7","next":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/in_theaters.json?page_limit=16&country=us&page=8","prev":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/in_theaters.json?page_limit=16&country=us&page=6","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/movie/in_theaters.php"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/in_theaters.json?page_limit={results_per_page}&page={page_number}&country={country-code}"}
