Frank Baum's beloved wizard character. When Oscar Diggs (James Franco), a small-time circus magician with dubious ethics, is hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz, he thinks he's hit the jackpot-fame and fortune are his for the taking-that is until he meets three witches, Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle Williams), who are not convinced he is the great wizard everyone's been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity-and even a bit of wizardry-Oscar transforms himself not only into the great wizard but into a better man as well. When small-time magician Oscar Diggs (James Franco) pulls one flimflam too many, he finds himself hurled into the fantastical Land of Oz where he must somehow transform himself into the great wizard-and just maybe into a better man as well. -- (C) Walt Disney","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/82/11168213_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/82/11168213_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/82/11168213_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/82/11168213_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"James Franco","id":"162653202","characters":["Oz","The Wizard"]},{"name":"Mila Kunis","id":"364629418","characters":["Theodora/Wicked Witch of the West","Theodorah"]},{"name":"Rachel Weisz","id":"162653682","characters":["Evanora"]},{"name":"Michelle Williams","id":"162653583","characters":["Annie/Glinda"]},{"name":"Zach Braff","id":"162655018","characters":["Frank/Finley","Oz's Assistant"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1623205"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771211175.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/oz_the_great_and_powerful/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771211175/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771211175/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771211175/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771211175/similar.json"}},{"id":"771324197","title":"The Call","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"R","runtime":95,"critics_consensus":"The Call builds plenty of suspense before taking a problematic turn in the third act.","release_dates":{"theater":"2013-03-15"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":40,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":71},"synopsis":"When veteran 911 operator, Jordan (Halle Berry), takes a life-altering call from a teenage girl (Abigail Breslin) who has just been abducted, she realizes that she must confront a killer from her past in order to save the girl's life.

For Reginald Paget (Tom Courtenay), Wilfred Bond (Billy Connolly) and Cecily Robson (Pauline Collins) this sort of talk is par for the course at the gossipy home. But they're in for a special shock when the new arrival turns out to be none other than their former singing partner, Jean Horton (Maggie Smith). Her subsequent career as a star soloist, and the ego that accompanied it, split up their long friendship and ended her marriage to Reggie, who takes the news of her arrival particularly hard.

And will the famous quartet be able to patch up their differences in time for Beecham House's gala concert? -- (C) Weinstein","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/79/11167905_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/79/11167905_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/79/11167905_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/79/11167905_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Maggie Smith","id":"162652436","characters":["Jean","Jean Horton"]},{"name":"Tom Courtenay","id":"162674631","characters":["Reggie Paget","Reginald","Reginald Paget"]},{"name":"Billy Connolly","id":"162662548","characters":["Wilf","Wilf Bond","Wilfred Bond"]},{"name":"Pauline Collins","id":"162672694","characters":["Cecily Robson","Cissy","Cissy Robson"]},{"name":"Michael Gambon","id":"162676818","characters":["Cedric","Cedric Livingston"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1441951"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771269968.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/quartet_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771269968/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771269968/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771269968/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771269968/similar.json"}},{"id":"771315558","title":"Emperor","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"PG-13","runtime":98,"critics_consensus":"Despite a typically strong performance from Tommy Lee Jones, Emperor does little with its fascinating historical palate, and is instead bogged down in a cliched romantic subplot.","release_dates":{"theater":"2013-03-08"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":33,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":65},"synopsis":"Matthew Fox (WORLD WAR Z, I, ALEX CROSS, \"Lost\") joins with Academy Award (R) winner Tommy Lee Jones (LINCOLN, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, THE FUGITIVE, HOPE SPRINGS), newcomer Eriko Hatsune and award-winning Japanese star Toshiyuki Nishida (GET UP!, TSURIBAKA NISSHI 14, TSURIBAKA NISSHI 6, GAKKO, DUN-HUANG) to bring to life the American occupation of Japan in the perilous and unpredictable days just after Emperor Hirohito's World War II surrender. As General Douglas MacArthur (Jones) suddenly finds himself the de facto ruler of a foreign nation, he assigns an expert in Japanese culture - and psychological warfare - General Bonner Fellers (Fox), to covertly investigate the looming question hanging over the country: should the Japanese Emperor, worshiped by his people but accused of war crimes, be punished or saved? Caught between the high-wire political intrigue of his urgent mission and his own impassioned search for the mysterious school teacher (Hatsune) who first drew him to Japan, Fellers can be certain only that the tricky subterfuge about to play out will forever change the history of two nations and his heart.
