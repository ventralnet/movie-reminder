Minnie Driver plays Viv, a fiery high school drama teacher determined to fire up her hormonal, apathetic students by putting on the best end-of-the-year show the school has ever seen... a glam rock-infused musical version of Shakespeare's The Tempest. But as the Welsh summer begins to heat up, can she compete with the typical teenage distractions of sex and drugs with some great rock and roll? Find out in this fantastic, rousing film- but remove all fears of the typical teen-pop covered high school musicals from your minds, as the songs in this film are from legendary artists like David Bowie, The Beach Boys, ELO, and The Byrds.

Beau Bridges plays an avuncular federal marshal, a good ol' boy, who turns out to be one of the operation's masterminds while Matt O'Leary is equally repellent as the boss's wildly erratic, drug-addled right-hand man. But it's Chung who breathes life into a story that could have been reduced to violent, even pornographic sensationalism, if not told so compassionately from the victim's point of view. Human trafficking is a $32 billion-a-year business, perpetrated throughout the world. EDEN gives a thoughtful, albeit mind-boggling perspective on how these crimes are sometimes committed in America within plain sight.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/16/95/11169598_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/16/95/11169598_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/16/95/11169598_det.jpg","original":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/16/95/11169598_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jamie Chung","id":"770694653","characters":["Eden"]},{"name":"Matt O'Leary","id":"351524952","characters":["Vaughan"]},{"name":"Beau Bridges","id":"162664689","characters":["Bob Gault"]},{"name":"Jeanine Monterozza","id":"771225332","characters":["Priscilla"]},{"name":"Scott Mechlowicz","id":"162690724","characters":["Jesse"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1734433"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771271074.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eden_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771271074/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771271074/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771271074/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771271074/similar.json"}},{"id":"771271078","title":"Gimme The Loot","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"Unrated","runtime":81,"release_dates":{"theater":"2013-03-22"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Fresh","critics_score":100,"audience_rating":"Spilled","audience_score":59},"synopsis":"Malcolm and Sofia, two determined teens from the Bronx, are the ultimate graffiti-writers.

As they dock on a sun-kissed beach where children are playing and giggling, everything seems perfect. But as they wander the strangely empty streets, an atmosphere of unease sets in: an abandoned hotel, a distress call that repeatedly echoes from a radio set, the sense of being watched...the sound of children's laughter drifting through the streets, but no adults in sight. What started as a day in paradise quickly turns into a struggle for survival.
