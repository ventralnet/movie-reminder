Now thirty, Celeste is the driven owner of her own media consulting firm, Jesse is once again unemployed and in no particular rush to do anything with his life. Celeste is convinced that divorcing Jesse is the right thing to do -- she is on her way up, he is on his way nowhere, and if they do it now instead of later, they can remain supportive friends. Jesse passively accepts this transition into friendship, even though he is still in love with her. As the reality of their separation sets in, Celeste slowly and painfully realizes she has been cavalier about their relationship, and her decision, which once seemed mature and progressive, now seems impulsive and selfish. But her timing with Jesse is less than fortuitous... -- (C) Sony Classics","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/56/11165673_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/56/11165673_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/56/11165673_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/56/11165673_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Rashida Jones","id":"364598291","characters":["Celeste"]},{"name":"Andy Samberg","id":"602828424","characters":["Jesse"]},{"name":"Chris Messina","id":"770680734","characters":["Paul"]},{"name":"Ari Graynor","id":"528342686","characters":["Beth"]},{"name":"Emma Roberts","id":"326298386","characters":["Riley"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1405365"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266291.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/celeste_and_jesse_forever/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266291/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266291/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266291/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266291/similar.json"}},{"id":"771225793","title":"So Undercover","year":2012,"mpaa_rating":"PG-13","runtime":96,"release_dates":{"dvd":"2013-02-05"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":7,"audience_rating":"Spilled","audience_score":51},"synopsis":"When the FBI hires her to go undercover at a college sorority, Molly Morris (Miley Cyrus) must transform herself from a tough, streetwise private investigator to a refined, sophisticated university girl to help protect the daughter of a one-time Mobster.

A plan so incredible, it could only happen in the movies. -- (C) Warner Bros.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/91/11169181_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/91/11169181_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/91/11169181_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/91/11169181_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Ben Affleck","id":"162665891","characters":["Tony Mendez"]},{"name":"Bryan Cranston","id":"326392501","characters":["Jack O'Donnell"]},{"name":"Alan Arkin","id":"162666144","characters":["Lester Siegel"]},{"name":"John Goodman","id":"162655706","characters":["John Chambers"]},{"name":"Taylor Schilling","id":"771036916","characters":["Christine Mendez"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1024648"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771256128.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/argo_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771256128/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771256128/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771256128/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771256128/similar.json"}},{"id":"9382","title":"Monsters, Inc. 3D","year":2012,"mpaa_rating":"G","runtime":92,"critics_consensus":"Even though Monsters, Inc lacks the sophistication of the Toy Story series, it is a still delight for children of all ages.","release_dates":{"theater":"2012-12-19","dvd":"2013-02-19"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Certified Fresh","critics_score":96,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":84},"synopsis":"After exploring the worlds of toys and bugs in the two Toy Story films and A Bug's Life, the award-winning computer animation company Pixar delves into the realm of monsters with its fourth feature. Hulking, blue-furred behemoth James P. \"Sully\" Sullivan (John Goodman) and his one-eyed assistant Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) are employed by Monsters, Inc., a scream processing factory. It seems that the denizens of their realm thrive on the screams of kids spooked by monsters lurking under their beds and in their closets. It's the job of Sully, Mike, and their co-workers, including sarcastic Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi), crab-like CEO Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn), and lovely snake-headed receptionist Celia (Jennifer Tilly) to keep the frights flowing. When Sully and Mike are followed back into the monster world by a very unafraid little human girl named Boo (Mary Gibbs), they are exiled to her universe, where they discover that such a modern-day mythological specimen as the Abominable Snowman is a fellow refugee. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/65/11166524_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/65/11166524_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/65/11166524_det.jpg","original":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/65/11166524_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"John Goodman","id":"162655706","characters":["James P.
