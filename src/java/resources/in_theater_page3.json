Hulking, blue-furred behemoth James P. \"Sully\" Sullivan (John Goodman) and his one-eyed assistant Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) are employed by Monsters, Inc., a scream processing factory. It seems that the denizens of their realm thrive on the screams of kids spooked by monsters lurking under their beds and in their closets. It's the job of Sully, Mike, and their co-workers, including sarcastic Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi), crab-like CEO Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn), and lovely snake-headed receptionist Celia (Jennifer Tilly) to keep the frights flowing. When Sully and Mike are followed back into the monster world by a very unafraid little human girl named Boo (Mary Gibbs), they are exiled to her universe, where they discover that such a modern-day mythological specimen as the Abominable Snowman is a fellow refugee. ~ Karl Williams, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/65/11166524_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/65/11166524_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/65/11166524_det.jpg","original":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/65/11166524_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"John Goodman","id":"162655706","characters":["James P.

Their budding but illicit romance screeches to a tragic halt when interplanetary-border patrol agents catch them and Eden suffers an apparently fatal fall. But when, ten years later, Adam learns she is alive and working at a vast corporation whose towering headquarters connects their planets, he sets out on a dangerous quest to infiltrate the company and the upper world to reconnect with her.

Two teenage girls - GINGER & ROSA - are inseparable. They skip school together, talk about love, religion and politics and dream of lives bigger than their mothers' domesticity. But the growing threat of nuclear war casts a shadow over their lives. Ginger (Elle Fanning) is drawn to poetry and protest, while Rosa (Alice Englert) shows Ginger how to smoke cigarettes, kiss boys and pray. Both rebel against their mothers: Rosa's single mum, Anoushka (Jodhi May), and Ginger's frustrated painter mother, Natalie (Christina Hendricks). Meanwhile, Ginger's pacifist father, Roland (Alessandro Nivola) seems a romantic, bohemian figure to the girls. He encourages Ginger's 'Ban-the-Bomb' activism, while Rosa starts to take a very different interest in him. As Ginger's parents fight and fall apart, Ginger finds emotional sanctuary with a gay couple, both named Mark (Timothy Spall and Oliver Platt), and their American friend, the poet Bella (Annette Bening). Finally, as the Cuban Missile Crisis escalates - and it seems the world itself may come to an end - the lifelong friendship of the two girls is shattered. Ginger clutches at one hope; if she can help save the world from extinction, perhaps she too will survive this moment of personal devastation.

It conjures up wistful smiles, memories of generations past...and no shortage of eye rolling. But as audiences will discover in Hava Nagila (The Movie), the song is much more than a tale of Jewish kitsch and bad bar mitzvah fashions. It carries with it an entire constellation of history, values and hopes for the future. In its own believe-it-or-not way, Hava Nagila encapsulates the Jewish journey over the past 150 years. It also reveals the power of one song to express and sustain identity, to transmit lessons across generations and to bridge cultural divides and connect us all on a universal level.

Still ferocious, charismatic, and hilariously blunt, the now 87-year-old Koch ruled New York from 1978 to 1989-a down-and-dirty decade of grit, graffiti, near-bankruptcy and rampant crime. First-time filmmaker (and former Wall Street Journal reporter) Neil Barsky has crafted an intimate and revealing portrait of this intensely private man, his legacy as a political titan, and the town he helped transform. The tumult of his three terms included a fiercely competitive 1977 election; an infamous 1980 transit strike; the burgeoning AIDS epidemic; landmark housing renewal initiatives; and an irreparable municipal corruption scandal. Through candid interviews and rare archival footage, Koch thrillingly chronicles the personal and political toll of running the world's most wondrous city in a time of upheaval and reinvention.

Eli's mother is a drug addict, and his father is physically abusive. When police answer a domestic disturbance call at Eli's home on his 10th birthday, the young boy is placed in a youth facility where compliance takes precedence over compassion. Meanwhile, Ken Matthews is an investment banker with a bright future. In a calculated effort to dazzle his latest client, a wealthy heiress, Ken volunteers at a youth camp for at-risk children. There, he's paired with Eli. As the two settle into the cabin shared with compassionate counselor Samuel and his quirky charge Redford, it doesn't take long for Ken to realize that he's way out of his league. Eli sees right through Ken, and lashes out at him whenever possible. At first, Ken responds with frustration and anger. The more he learns about Eli's tragic past however, the more his heart goes out to him. In time Ken learns to love Eli unconditionally, a love that's soon challenged when the young boy's brutish father pays an unexpected visit to the camp. At that moment Eli's plight becomes real to Ken, prompting the once-neglectful counselor to do some serious soul searching, and make a sacrifice that could drastically alter the future of the boy who's stuck in a dangerous downward spiral. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/01/11170153_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/01/11170153_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/01/11170153_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/17/01/11170153_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Michael Mattera","id":"771436535","characters":["Ken","Ken Matthews"]},{"name":"Miles Elliot","id":"771436533","characters":["Eli"]},{"name":"Asante Jones","id":"771278978","characters":["Samuel","Samuel Smith"]},{"name":"Michael Jacob Wayne","id":"771439363","characters":["Redford"]},{"name":"Grace Johnston","id":"770680671","characters":["Tammi","Tammie Parker"]}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771350030.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/camp_2013/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771350030/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771350030/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771350030/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771350030/similar.json"}}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/in_theaters.json?page_limit=16&country=us&page=3","next":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/in_theaters.json?page_limit=16&country=us&page=4","prev":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/in_theaters.json?page_limit=16&country=us&page=2","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/movie/in_theaters.php"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/lists/movies/in_theaters.json?page_limit={results_per_page}&page={page_number}&country={country-code}"}
