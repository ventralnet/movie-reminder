Directors Kristi Jacobson and Lori Silverbush examine this issue through the lens of three people for who are struggling with food insecurity: Barbie, a single Philadelphia mother who grew up in poverty and is trying to provide a better life for her two kids; Rosie, a Colorado second-grader who often has to depend on friends and neighbors to feed her and has trouble concentrating in school; and Tremonica, a Mississippi second-grader whose asthma and health issues are exacerbated by the largely empty calories her hardworking mother can afford. Their stories are interwoven with insights from experts including sociologist Janet Poppendieck, author Raj Patel and nutrition policy leader Marion Nestle; ordinary citizens like Pastor Bob Wilson and teachers Leslie Nichols and Odessa Cherry; and activists such as Witness to Hunger's Mariana Chilton, Top Chef's Tom Colicchio and Oscar (R)-winning actor Jeff Bridges. Ultimately, Finding North shows us how hunger poses serious economic, social and cultural implications for our nation, and that it could be solved once and for all, if the American public decides - as they have in the past - that making healthy food available and affordable is in the best interest of us all.

As her lover from the West carefully plots her escape, Barbara waits patiently and avoids friendships with her colleagues-except for Andre (Ronald Zehrfeld) the hospital's head physician, who is warmly attentive to her. But even as she finds herself falling for him, Barbara still cannot be sure that Andre is not a spy. As her defensive wall slowly starts to crumble, she is eventually forced to make a profound decision about her future.

Although inspired by a real story that took place in Burma, Nguyen decided to film War Witch in the Democratic Republic of the Congo without giving a specific location to the plot. He worked on the film for 10 years, watching and catching children's points of view with his camera and mixing in tightly edited flashbacks in which the spirits of human beings appear with an ultra-realistic and violent storyline. But War Witch is also a poignant and impossible love story filled with magic, picturesque images, and even light moments like the powerful visit to an albino camp or the chasing of a white rooster.

Wildfires in the West. \"Brown-Outs\" in the East. Farmers losing crops to the worst drought since the Dust Bowl. Climate change is no longer a prediction for the future, but a startling reality of today. Yet, as evidence of our changing climate mounts and the scientific consensus proves human causation, there continues to be no political action to thwart the warming of our planet. \"Greedy Lying Bastards\" investigates the reason behind stalled efforts to tackle climate change despite consensus in the scientific community that it is not only a reality but also a growing problem placing us on the brink of disaster. The film details the people and organizations casting doubt on climate science and claims that greenhouse gases are not affected by human behavior. From the Koch Brothers to ExxonMobil, to prominent Senators and Justices, this provocative expose unravels the layers of deceit threatening U.S. democracy. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/92/11169241_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/92/11169241_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/92/11169241_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/92/11169241_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Dr. Kevin Trenberth","id":"771439404"},{"name":"Dr. Michael Mann","id":"771439405"},{"name":"Mike Petkash","id":"771439406"},{"name":"Maria Petkash","id":"771439407"},{"name":"Bill Brown","id":"770750632"}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2069784"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771265290.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/greedy_lying_bastards_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771265290/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771265290/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771265290/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771265290/similar.json"}},{"id":"771307291","title":"Beyond The Hills","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"Unrated","runtime":155,"critics_consensus":"Although some viewers may mistake its deliberate pace for passionless filmmaking, Beyond the Hills offers an intelligent, powerfully acted examination of the tension between secular life and religious faith.","release_dates":{"theater":"2013-03-08"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Certified Fresh","critics_score":87,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":82},"synopsis":"In an isolated Orthodox convent in Romania, Alina has just been reunited with Voichita after spending several years in Germany.

Alina cannot understand her friend's choice. In her attempt to win back Voichita's affection, she challenges the priest. She is taken to hospital and the people of the monastery start to suspect that she is possessed. When the doctors send her back, Alina is included in the monastic routine in the hope that she will find peace. But her condition worsens and they finally have to tie her to a wooden plank to prevent her from hurting herself. After ruling out all other options, the priest and nuns decide to read her prayers to deliver those possessed by the Evil One. They perform an exorcism, but the result is not what they had hoped, and Voichita begins to doubt the religious choice she has made. She decides to free Alina - but her decision comes too late.
